Data Source
The historical stock data is sourced from the Alpha Vantage API. This API provides daily, weekly, and monthly stock prices, which are essential for training and testing the model.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language used for data processing and modeling.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
MySQL: Used for storing historical stock data in AWS RDS.
TensorFlow & Keras: For building and training LSTM models.
ARIMA: For time series forecasting.
AWS EC2: Hosting the application and running scheduled tasks.
AWS RDS: Managed MySQL database for storing stock data.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+
MySQL Server
AWS CLI configured with necessary permissions
Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/apple-stock-prediction.git
cd apple-stock-prediction
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the MySQL database:

Create a database named Apple_stock.
Update the db_config dictionary in common_db.py with your MySQL credentials.
Run the script to create the necessary tables:
bash
Copy code
python common_db.py
Fetch and insert stock data:

bash
Copy code
python insert_api_data.py
Train the model and make predictions:

bash
Copy code
python model.py
Usage
Insert New Data: Use insert_api_data.py to fetch the latest stock data from Alpha Vantage and insert it into your MySQL database.
Predict Stock Prices: Run model.py to train the model on the latest data and predict future stock prices.
View Results: The results, including visualizations, will be saved in the static directory.
